- [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/)
- [axios](https://axios-http.com/ptbr/docs/intro)
- The following [API](https://github.com/DEVinZucchetti/api_academia)

## Running the project
First, be sure to properly adquire the needed dependencies:
- Node

The following technologies are optional, but highly recommended when developing the project:
- Bun

To use the program, run the following scripts:
- clone the project indo the desired folder:
  ``` {
  git clone https://github.com/lanerLF/projeto-modulo-1/
- navigate to the folder:
  ``` {
  cd projeto-modulo-1
- run the install method of your desired package manager (bun, npm, pnpm, yarn, etc)
   ``` {
  npm install
  npm install vuetify
  npm install @mdi/font -D
  npm install axios
  npm install bootstrap
  ```
- run the script to initiate vite local server for development:
  ``` {
  npm run dev
- after, make sure to clone the [API](https://github.com/DEVinZucchetti/api_academia) into the desired folder:
  ``` {
  git clone https://github.com/DEVinZucchetti/api_academia
- navigate to the API folder:

  cd api_academia
- run the install method of the Node Package Manager (specifically, because the api is configured to run on it):
  ``` {
  npm install
- run the following script to initiate the nodejs server of the API:
  ``` {
  npm run server

## Recommended editor for project modifications
For this project I would highly recommend the usage of the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor if you are trying to develop on it, however, any code editor of choice should work just fine.
For IDE's, WebStorm is the only one I know that can handle web development, so stick with it or switch to a text editor.

## Improvements that can be done
The following self-feedback regards the improvements I believe that can be done in this project:
- proper implementation of the last page of the application
- esthetical improvements
- cleaning the code
- logical improvements regarding post and get requests
